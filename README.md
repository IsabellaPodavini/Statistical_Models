# Statistical_Models
This is the project for the Statistical Models course of the Master of Science degree in Data Science at the University of Verona

*Brief description of the dataset:*
This dataset contains daily measurements of temperature, wind capacity and wind generation (i.e., wind production) from 2017 to 2019 in Germany.

*Project steps:*
The main aim of this project is to forecast the wind power generation for the last month of 2019 (December).
Following what we have seen during the lessons, a comprehensive pipeline should be devised, including:
1. Loading, converting and cleaning of the data;
2. Exploring the dataset with descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. Use appropriate graphs to visualise the data at hand;
3. Describe the time series patterns (visually and numerically);
4. Choosing the appropriate model(s) to forecast the required data for the specified period. Evaluate the model performance using different metrics. Visualise the results with appropriate graphs. 

For the different steps, comment on the main results and any relevant observation/finding you have noticed.
